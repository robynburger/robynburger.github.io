<h1 id="longest-k-repeated-subsequence-approximation-algorithm-525">Longest K-Repeated Subsequence Approximation Algorithm (5/25)</h1>

<p>Abstract: Finding repeated subsequences is a classical problem in computer science. Most variants of this problem rely on computing the longest common subsequence (LCS). Our interest is in the longest k-repeated subsequence
problem (LkRS), which is the problem of returning the longest subsequence of a string w that is repeated k times. Our contribution is an O(n^2) algorithm that, for any k &gt; 0, finds a k-repeated subsequence that is at least
2/3 the optimal length. The algorithm relies our analysis of the inherent combinatorial properties of the setting. The following is a proof of one such property.</p>

<h1 id="allocation-of-scientific-credit-with-altruistic-players-1224">Allocation of Scientific Credit with Altruistic Players (12/24)</h1>

<p>Abstract:
The process by which a researcher selects the focus of their studies can be impacted by both selfish and selfless motivations. The collective result of these motivations shapes the direction of the body of literature of scientific communities. In this work, we adapt Kleinberg and Oren’s 2010 model of the allocation of credit in the scientific community to include the notion of altruism. We redefine each researcher’s utility to be a linear combination of their own credit and the credits of their friends, weighted by an altruism parameter. Through this modification, we analyze the impact of altruism on the Price of Anarchy, demonstrating that altruistic behavior can lead to more socially optimal outcomes under certain conditions. Additionally, we note that researchers realistically do not have full information about which other researchers are working on certain projects. We thus explore learning dynamics using multiplicative weights, showing that altruistic researchers are more likely to converge to efficient allocations. These results suggest that altruistic motivations within scientific communities can enhance overall productivity.</p>

<p>Abstract: 
Information networks offer valuable insights throughthe analysis of their structure and data. However, these networks often contain sensitive information, presenting privacy concerns if analyzed or published directly. Algorithms designed to privatize these datasets must be careful to obscure enough information as to ensure privacy, but not so much as to lose the original properties of the graph. The balance of usefulness and privacy of information is highly dependent on the nature of the dataset. We explore optimizations to PrivGraph, an algorithm that offers one such definition of privacy, differential privacy, while preserving network metrics such as community finding and average degree. Although PrivGraph is tested over a variety of hyper-parameters, provided with an unknown dataset, there are few guidelines for how to divide the privacy budget ε among stages or set community initialization hyper-parameter, N. In order to address these ambiguities, we develop and test a linear regression model on the hyperparameter results.</p>
