<!-- # About Me -->
Hello! My name is Robyn. I am a first year [M.S.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/ms) student at Cornell University where I am fortunate to be advised by [Paul G&#246;lz](https://paulgoelz.de/) and [Sid Banerjee](https://sidbanerjee.orie.cornell.edu/). My research is at the intersection of theoretical computer science and ORIE. 

In May, I graduated Cornell University with majors in mathematics and computer science. 
These days, I am most interested in algorithmic game theory and optimization. I love learning new things, meeting new people, and am always happy to chat!
