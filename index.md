# About Me


Hello! My name is Robyn. I am a rising senior at Cornell University, studying CS and math.

I am currently enjoying an REU at Montana State University, where my work involves computational biology, high-performance computing, and integer linear programming. I love creating intricate algorithms to solve hard problems. I'm also interested in post-quantum cryptographic schemes, such as lattice-based cryptography.
