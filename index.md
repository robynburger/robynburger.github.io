# About Me


Hello! My name is Robyn. I am a rising senior at Cornell University, studying CS and math.

This summer, I participated in an REU at Montana State University, where I my research focused on algorithms, computational biology, and integer linear programming. I love creating intricate algorithms to solve hard problems, and exploring interdisciplinary applications of computer science.   I'm also interested in post-quantum cryptographic schemes, such as lattice-based cryptography.
