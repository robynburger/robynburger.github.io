# About Me


Hello! My name is Robyn. I am a senior at Cornell University, studying CS and math.

This summer, I participated in an REU at Montana State University, where I my research focused on algorithms, computational biology, and integer linear programming. I love creating intricate algorithms to solve hard problems, and exploring interdisciplinary applications of computer science.   I'm also interested in post-quantum cryptographic schemes, such as lattice-based cryptography.

This semester, I am focusing on a research problem to optimize an existing solution for the longest cubic subsequence problem, wherin the goal is to find the longest subsequence that is repeated three times within a string. I've been having fun with this problem, which involves linear algebra, dynamic programming, and theorizing about multidimensional matrices. 

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you have fun clicking on the various things to click on!
