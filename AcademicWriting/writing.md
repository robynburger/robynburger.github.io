# Optimizing PrivGraph: The Impact of Community Initialization and Privacy Budget Allocation Strategies on Differential Privacy (12/23)

Abstract: 
Information networks offer valuable insights throughthe analysis of their structure and data. However, these networks often contain sensitive information, presenting privacy concerns if analyzed or published directly. Algorithms designed to privatize these datasets must be careful to obscure enough information as to ensure privacy, but not so much as to lose the original properties of the graph. The balance of usefulness and privacy of information is highly dependent on the nature of the dataset. We explore optimizations to PrivGraph, an algorithm that offers one such definition of privacy, differential privacy, while preserving network metrics such as community finding and average degree. Although PrivGraph is tested over a variety of hyper-parameters, provided with an unknown dataset, there are few guidelines for how to divide the privacy budget Îµ among stages or set community initialization hyper-parameter, N. In order to address these ambiguities, we develop and test a linear regression model on the hyperparameter results.
